        <p> I was born in Denton, Texas, but currently live in Reading, Pennsylvania.
            <br> I am a junior Advertising major and English and Textual Studies minor.
            <br> I enjoy reading and writing dystopian and science-fiction literature, as well as watching TV and movies. I love to explore new cafes, bookstores, and stationary stores in my free time.
